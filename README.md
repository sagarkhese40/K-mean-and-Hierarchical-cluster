# K-mean-and-Hierarchical-cluster

crime data Jupyter notebook performs clustering analysis on a crime dataset using K-Means and Agglomerative clustering algorithms. The dataset contains crime statistics (Murder, Assault, UrbanPop, Rape) for different US states

This project applies K-Means Clustering to segment airline customers based on their behavior and travel data. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to help the airline improve its customer relationship strategies and marketing efforts.

Clustering Analysis
 1.K-Means Clustering
  Determines optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
  Implements K-Means clustering
  Evaluates clusters using silhouette score
2.Agglomerative Clustering
  Performs hierarchical clustering
  Visualizes dendrogram to help determine cluster count
  Implements Agglomerative clustering
